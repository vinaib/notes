# architecture specific: arch/
## Processor specific
## SoC specific
## Board specific

# arm "Processor specific" realted code in linux kernel 
## arch/arm/kernel
## arch/arm/mm
## arch/arm/boot/compressed
## arch/arm/boot/lib

# SoC specific
## arch/arm/mach-xxx
### for TI: SoC based on OMAP 1: "mach-omap1"
### for TI: SoC based on OMAP2/3/4, AM3XX SoC: "mach-ompa2"
### fot TI: SoC based on Davinci: "mach-davinci"
## mach-XXX folder contains:
### SoC related shared code between different boards
#### peripheral initialization whihc are same across boards
#### helper functions
### Board file: After introduction of dts, these board files is no longer valid
#### usually starts with board-xxx.c
#### Having dts files, all board files are removed and introduced "board-generic" board file which is generic to all the boards which are based on same SoC families.
#### if you see odler kernel versions, linux 3.4.113, you can see board files

Building kernel
----------------
# dist clean, it also clean tags, cleans every generated file
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- KBUILD_OUTPUT=/home/vinai/projects/bbb/out/linux distclean

# generate .config from default config
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabhihf- KBUILD_OUTPUT=/home/vinai/projects/bbb/out/linux bb.org_defconfig

# make menuconfig
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- KBUILD_OUTPUT=/home/vinai/projects/bbb/out/linux menuconfig
# Generate uImage
## if uImage option is given then along with zImage, Image, uImage is also generated.
## load address of uImage, which is read by u-boot, this is required for 3.7+ multi platform support in kernel
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- KBUILD_OUTPUT=/home/vinai/projects/bbb/out/linux uImage dtbs LOADADDR=0x80008000 -j16

# compile modules
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- KBUILD_OUTPUT=/home/vinai/projects/bbb/out/linux modules -j12

# install modules on filesystem
make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/home/vinai/projects/bbb/out/filesystem KBUILD_OUTPUT=/home/vinai/projects/bbb/out/linux modules_install -j12

# file /lib/modules/<kernel version>/modules.builtin contains list of all modules which are statistically linked to kernel.

# see modules.order, 
# modules.dep: lists all modules dependencies
# modprobe : refers modules.dep to find out the dependencies and load these modules before loading the asked module.

# Adding dtb as part of zImage
cat arch/arm/boot/zImage arch/arm/boot/dts/myboard.dtb > my-zImage
mkimage ... -d my-zImage my-uImage
