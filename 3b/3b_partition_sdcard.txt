Creating Partitons
--------------------
# use gpart software to partition SD card.
# sd card partitions 2
## Partition 1: Boot: Fat16: 
## Partition 2: Rootfs: Ext3: 

# for partitioning use gpart gui software, install it from ubuntu software
# launch gpart, delete any existing partitions and create new partition
## boot partition: type fat16: size 512M: and leave rest options as default: press add 
## rootfs partition: type ext3: size whatever left over:press add
## then select "Apply All Operations", takes some time to apply all changes
## Once done, select boot partition, right click, select "manage flags" -> select "boot"

# copying images to sd card
## MLO/SPL: Download/build MLO binary and copy it to boot partition as name "MLO". This name must match else it wont be picked up
### on BBB, SPL/MLO is part of uboot: you see it as U-Boot SPL 
## UBOOT: download/build uboot binary and copy it to boot partition as name "u-boot.img"
## ROOTFS: Download/build root and uimage and copy it to rootfs partition.
## UENV.TXT: and add uEnv.txt to boot partition, which tells the u-boot from where it has to pick the uImage

# Boot from SD card on BBB
## press and hold the S2 button (Boot button)
## press the S3 button (Power button)
## Release S2 button

# create partitions using fdisk
## connect sdcard. if it has partitions then unmount it 
## in this example on connecting of sd card it had two partitions.
## sudo umount /dev/sdb1
## sudo umount /dev/sdb2

## sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
p - to print existing partition on sd card
d - to delete partition
m - for help
command: d 
select partition: 1
Partition 1 will be deleted
#delete the second partiion too

#create new parition
command : n
partition type:
p: primary
e: extended
command : p
parition number(1 - 4, default 1): 1
First sector: default value
Last sector: provide size of primary partition: +32M

Do you want to remove signature? Y
Signature will be removed by write command

# create second parition for rootfs: Give all the remaining space to this partition
command: n
partiion type: p 
partition number: 2
First sector: default
Last Sector: default

Created new partition 2 of type LInux and of size 
Do you want to remove siganture? it asks only if earlier partition had any filesystem signature.

# Make the first partiton bootable by setting the boot flag.
command: a
partition number: 1
the bootable flag on partition 1 is enabled.

# set partition 1 with fat32
command: t
partition number: 1
Hex code: c select for W95 FAT32(LBA)

# set the partition 2 with ext2
command: t
partition number: 2
Hex code: 83 (Linux) it will be ext3/4

command: p
# write the partition table to /dev/sdb
command: w 

# format the parttion /dev/sdb1 with fat32 and label it with BOOT
sudo mkfs.vfat -n "BOOT" /dev/sdb1

# format the partition /dev/sdb2 with ext3/4 and label it with ROOTFS
sudo mkfs.ext4 -L "ROOTFS" /dev/sdb2

# copy MLO, uboot, kernel, dtb to BOOT partition
sudo cp MLO /media/$USER/BOOT
sudo cp uboot.img /media/$USER/BOOT
sudo cp zImgae /media/$USER/BOOT
sudo cp am335x-boneblack.dtb /media/$USER/BOOT

# extract rootfs to /media/$USER/ROOT
sudo tar -xf core-image-minimal-beaglebone-yocto.tar.bz2 -C /media/$USER/ROOT
