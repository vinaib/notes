BBB: CONFIG_FLATMEM is defined in its Kconfig

CONFIG_FLATMEM:
- This model is suitable for non-NUMA systems
- global mem_map array that maps the entire physical memory
- To allocate the mem_map array, architecture specific setup code should call
  free_area_init() function
- mappings array is not usable until the call to memblock_free_all() that hands
  all the memory to the page allocator.  
- With FLATMEM, the conversion between a PFN and the struct page is
  straightforward: PFN - ARCH_PFN_OFFSET is an index to the mem_map array.  
- The ARCH_PFN_OFFSET defines the first page frame number for systems with
  physical memory starting at address different from 0.				   

CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM

CONFIG_SPARSEMEM

Regardless of the selected memory model, there exists one-to-one mapping between
the physical page frame number (PFN) and the corresponding struct page.

Each memory model defines pfn_to_page() and page_to_pfn() helpers that allow the
conversion from PFN to struct page and vice versa.
