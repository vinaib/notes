# The arm instruction swi is deprecated and gets converted to svc during
# assembly

# The argument to svc does not have to be zero. The cpu does not use this value.
# Software has the option to use the argument in the interrupt handler, but
# Linux does not. Linux syscalls rely only on the arguments passed in registers.
# That means we can use any number as the svc argument (subject to some max
# ranges) 

# Syscall numbers for the system can be found in the unistd-common.h header
# file. (cat /usr/include/asm/unistd-common.h)

# arch/ABI		arg1 arg2  arg3  arg4  arg5  arg6  arg7
# arm/EABI      r0    r1    r2    r3    r4    r5    r6
