# An ARM multi-core processor can contain between one and four cores

# Each core can be individually configured to take part (or not) in a data cache coherency management scheme 

SCU:
----
# A Snoop Control Unit (SCU) device inside the processor has the task of
  automatically maintaining level 1 data cache coherency, between cores within
  the cluster without software intervention.

Interrupt Controller: GIC 400
-----------------------------
# ARM multi-core processors include an integrated interrupt controller. 
# Multiple external interrupt sources can be independently configured to target
  one or more of the individual processor cores.
# furthermore each core is able to signal (or broadcast) any interrupt to any
  other core or set of cores in the system, from software.
# These mechanisms enable the OS to share and distribute interrupts across all
  cores and to coordinate activities using the low-overhead signaling mechanisms
  provided.

Multiprocessor Hardware mechansims:
------------------------------------
# Cortex-A MPCore processors also provide hardware mechanisms to accelerate OS
  kernel operations such as system-wide cache and TLB maintenance operations.

# Each of the Cortex-A series multi-core processors have the following features:
• Configurable between one and four cores (at design time).
• Level 1 data cache coherency.
• Integrated interrupt controller.
• Local timers and watchdogs.
• An optional Accelerator Coherency Port (ACP).

Energy consumption:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The overall energy consumption of a multi-core system can be significantly lower than that of a system based on a single processor core
- Multiple cores enable execution to be completed faster and so some elements of the system might be completely powered down for longer periods
- Alternatively, a system with multiple cores might be able to operate at a lower frequency than that required by a single processor to achieve the same throughput
- Most current systems do not permit the frequency of cores to be changed independently. 
- However, each core can be dynamically clock gated, giving additional power and energy savings.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multi cores system designs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- A system that contains one or two cores could be scaled up for more performance by adding additional cores, without requiring redesign of the whole system or significant changes to software.
- Having multiple cores at our disposal also enables more options for system configuration.
  Example:
  - you might have a system that uses separate cores, one to handle a hard real-time requirement
  - another for an application requiring high, uninterrupted performance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
more Responsive than single core
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Wheninterrupts are distributed between cores there will be more than one core available to respond to an interrupt and fewer interrupts per core to be serviced.
- Multiple cores will also enable an important background process to progress simultaneously with an important but unrelated foreground process

Heterogeneous system:
---------------------
- ARM processors were likely to be implemented in systems that contained other
processors, this is commonly meant to be heterogeneous systems

- containing an ARM processor plus a separate DSP processor

- Such systems have different software executing on different cores and the individual processors can have differing privileges and views of memory
- Many widely used ARM systems, such as the TI OMAP series, or the Freescale i.MX, are examples of this.

We can distinguish between systems that contain:
--------------------------------------------------
• A single processor containing a single core, such as the Cortex-A8 processor

• A multi-core processor, that contains several cores capable of independent
instruction execution, that can be externally viewed as a single unit or
cluster, either by the system designer or by an operating system that can
abstract the underlying resources from the application layer.
A7 Processor having 4 cores, RPI2
A7 is one cluster

• Multiple clusters in which each cluster contains multiple cores.
System having A7 Processor and A15 Processors with each processor having
multiple cores. 
A7 is one cluster
A15 is another cluster
