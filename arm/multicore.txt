# An ARM multi-core processor can contain between one and four cores

# Each core can be individually configured to take part (or not) in a data cache
# coherency management scheme. A Snoop Control Unit (SCU) device inside the
# processor has the task of automatically maintaining level 1 data cache
# coherency, between cores within the cluster without software intervention.

# ARM multi-core processors include an integrated interrupt controller. Multiple
# external interrupt sources can be independently configured to target one or
# more of the individual processor cores.

# each core is able to signal (or broadcast) any interrupt to any other core or
# set of cores in the system, from software.

# Cortex-A MPCore processors also provide hardware mechanisms to accelerate OS
# kernel operations such as system-wide cache and TLB maintenance operations.

# Each of the Cortex-A series multi-core processors have the following features:
• Configurable between one and four cores (at design time).
• Level 1 data cache coherency.
• Integrated interrupt controller.
• Local timers and watchdogs.
• An optional Accelerator Coherency Port (ACP).
