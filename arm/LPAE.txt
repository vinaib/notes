LPAE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) LPAE is an OPTIONAL extension to the ARMv7-A architecture profile
2) LPAE must also include multiprocessor extension
3) LPAE adds new translation table format
Long-descriptor translation table format
4) Without LPAE
Short-descriptor translation table format
5) LPAE implementation must support both Translation table formats
6) The addition of a requirement that LDRD and STRD accesses to 64-bit aligned
locations are 64-bit single-copy atomic as seen by translation table walks and
accesses to translation tables.
7) The Long-descriptor translation table format always includes the PXN
attribute.
8) In short-descriptor translation table format inclusion of PXN attribute is
optional
9) Implementation including multiprocessing instruction cannot include FCSE
10) SEE ARM ARM V7A B1-1159
