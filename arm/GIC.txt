# Multi-core processors include an integrated interrupt controller that
# implements the GIC architecture.

# This controller provides 32 private interrupts per core.

# lower 16 are Software Generated Interrupts (SGI) that can be generated only
# through software operations.

# and the rest are Private Peripheral Interrupts (PPI).

# It also provides a configurable number of Shared Peripheral Interrupts (SPI),
# up to 224 in current multi-core implementations.

# It supports interrupt prioritization, pre-emption and routing to different
# cores.

# In a multi-core processor, the GIC control registers are memory-mapped and
# located within the Private memory region.

# The Interrupt Processor Targets registers configure that cores individual
# interrupts are routed to.

# The registers controlling the private interrupts (0-31) are banked, so that
# each core can have its own configuration for these. This includes priority
# configuration and the enabling or disabling of individual interrupts.

# The Software Generated Interrupt (SGI) Register can assert a private SGI on
# any core, or a groups of cores.

# The interrupt acknowledge register bits [12:10] will provide the ID of the
# core that made the request.

# In both AMP and SMP systems, it is likely that cores will trigger interrupts
# on other cores (or themselves), a so called softirq.

# These can be used for kernel synchronization operations, or for communicating
# between AMP cores. For operations requiring more information passed than a
# raised interrupt, you can use a shared buffer to store messages.
