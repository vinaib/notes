1) in multiprocessor/cores will there be separate MMU for each core?
logically: yes. but try to find answer

2) in multiprocessor/core, if 4 different process are running how MMU works?

3) in arm arch how exception vector table can be either at 0x0 (lower address)
	or at 0xFFFF0000 (higher address)? in this kind of arch on reset where core
	will look up for exception vector table? 

4) 	Linux maps (4KB page) exception vectors to virtual address 0xFFFF0000 or
0x00000000? how is this done? how it can map to desired virtual address? Need to
check.
