# Buildroot will generate all the images which are listed in readme.txt file under board/<board name> folder.
## in our example, it is board/beaglebone/readme.txt
# We can also insttruct buildroot to generate images only what we require, i.e. we can select/deselect what to build and not to build.
# First command to proceeed is make beaglebone_defconfig
## defconfig files can be found at configs/ folder
# After that run, make menuconfig
# Configure toolchain path, which you have it locally
# uncheck kernel, uboot as you have them already.
# run make -j4, once it fails create output/images directory and rerun make -j4.
# this creates only rootfs.tar
# extract your rootfs.tar to your nfs root directory. tar -xf rootfs.tar -C /srv/nfs/bbb
# root:root, 
# ssh -l root 192.168.1.30 :to login through ssh
