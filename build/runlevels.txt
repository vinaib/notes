# /etc/inittab for system V init 
# /etc/init.d/rcS for busybox init
# How to trigger these Runlevels
# After linux boots, the init program reads the /etc/inittab file to determine the behavior 
# for each runlevel. Unless the user specifies another value as a kernel boot parameter, the
# system will attempt to enter the default runlevel.
# /etc/inittab is used to set the default run level for system
# type runlevel on prompt to know current run level
