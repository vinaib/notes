# start_kernel is entry point for arch independent kernel initialization
# this function is defined in init/main.c
# it initializes everthing from Printing banner to mouting rootfs and launchin init first process.
# after all subsystems initialization it calls rest_init at last.
# the rest_init creates two kernel threads:
## kernel_init : pid 1: calls user init thread: used to spawn first linux application i.e. init.
### tries to launch: /sbin/init or /etc/init or /bin/init or /bin/sh
## kthreadd: pid 2: used to spawn other kernel thread
# after launching these two threads, it starts "idle" thread and calls schedule() to kick scheduler.
## idle thread is infinite loop while(1)
